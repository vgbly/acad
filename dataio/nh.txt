and females. In animals that have separate
sexes, males and females always differ, but
in highly dimorphic species, such as elephant
seals, the two sexes look very different and
are often unequal in size.
SHOOT
The aerial part of plant. It is a new growth,
usually growing upwards.
SHRUB
Woody perennial plant with multiple stems.
SIMPLE LEAF
A leaf with an undivided blade.
SPERMATOPHORE
A packet of sperm that is transferred
either directly from male to female, or
indirectly – for example, by being left
on the ground. Spermatophores are
produced by a range of animals, including
salamanders, squid, and some arthropods.
SPIRACLE
In some fish, an opening behind the
eye that lets water flow into the gills. In
insects and myriapods, the spiracle is an
opening on the body wall that lets air
into the tracheal system.
SPORE
A single cell containing half the quantity of
genetic material of typical body cells. Unlike
gametes, spores can divide and grow without
being fertilized. Spores are produced by
fungi, algae, and plants.
SPOROPHYTE
The spore-producing stage of a plant. It
is the dominant (visible) stage of ferns and
seed plants.
STAMEN
Male reproductive part of a flower. It has
an anther borne on a long filament.
STEREOSCOPIC (VISION)
Vision in which the two eyes face forward,
giving overlapping fields of view and allowing
the animal to judge distance. Also called
binocular vision.
STOMA (PL. STOMATA)
Tiny adjustable pore on the surface of a
plant that allows the exchange of gases
for photosynthesis and respiration.
SWIM BLADDER
A gas-filled bladder that most bony fish
use to regulate their buoyancy. By adjusting
the gas pressure inside the bladder, a fish
can become neutrally buoyant, meaning
that it neither rises nor sinks.
SYMBIOSIS
Any relationship between two different
species within an ecological community.
Examples of symbiotic relationships
are predator–prey, parasite–host,
and mutualism.
TEPAL
The outer part of a flower undifferentiated
into sepals and petals. Tepals collectively
make up the perianth.
TERRESTRIAL
Living wholly or mainly on the ground.
TERRITORY
An area defended by an animal, or group
of animals, against other members of the
same species. Territories often include
resources, such as food supply, that help
the male attract a mate.
THORAX
The middle region of an arthropod’s body.
The thorax contains powerful muscles and,
if the animal has any, bears legs and wings.
In vertebrates with four limbs, the thorax
is the chest.
TORPOR
A sleep-like state in which body processes
slow to a fraction of their normal rate.
Animals usually become torpid to survive
difficult conditions, such as extreme cold
or lack of food.
TRACHEAL SYSTEM
A system of minute tubes that arthropods
(for example, insects) use to carry oxygen
into their bodies. Air enters the tubes
through openings called spiracles, and
then flows through the tracheae to reach
individual cells.
TREE
A woody perennial plant usually with a
well-defined stem, or trunk, and a crown
of branches above.
UNGULATE
A hoofed mammal.
UTERUS
In female mammals, the part of the
body that contains and usually nourishes
developing young. In placental mammals,
the young are connected to the wall of
the uterus via a placenta.
VECTOR
An organism that transmits a disease-causing
parasite from one host to another.
VEIL
Thin skin- or web-like tissue that protects
the fruitbody of a fungus.
VESTIGIAL
Relating to an organ that is atrophied
or non-functional.
VIVIPAROUS
Reproducing by giving birth to live young.
VOLVA
A sac-like remnant of a veil at the base
of a fungus’s fruitbody stem.
WOODY PLANT
A plant that has wood – a type of
strengthening tissue found in plants
consisting of thick-walled watertransporting vessels.
ZYGODACTYL FEET
A specialized arrangement of the feet in
which the toes are arranged in pairs, with
the second and third toes facing forwards
and the first and fourth toes facing
backwards. This adaptation helps birds to
climb and perch on tree-trunks and other
vertical surfaces. Several groups of birds
have zygodactyl feet, including parrots,
cuckoos, turacos, owls, and toucans,
woodpeckers, and their relatives.
